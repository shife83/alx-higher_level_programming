Introduction

Input/Output (I/O) is fundamental to any programming language, and Python provides robust mechanisms for interacting with the user and external data sources. This guide explores various I/O functionalities to enhance your Python programming skills.

Key Concepts

Standard Streams: Three built-in streams for I/O:
stdin (standard input): User input through the keyboard (default input source).
stdout (standard output): Output displayed to the console (default output destination).
stderr (standard error): Used for error messages and debugging information (default error output destination).
print() Function: The primary function for writing to stdout. It can take multiple arguments separated by commas, automatically adding a newline character by default.
input() Function: Reads a line of text from stdin. The input is always treated as a string, so you might need to convert it to a specific data type (e.g., int(), float()) if necessary.
File I/O: Python offers various methods for reading from and writing to files:
open(): Opens a file in a specific mode (e.g., "r" for reading, "w" for writing, "a" for appending).
read(): Reads the entire content of a file into a string (in read modes).
readline(): Reads a single line from a file (in read modes).
readlines(): Reads all lines of a file into a list (in read modes).
write(): Writes a string to a file (in write or append modes).
close(): Essential to close the file after use to release resources.
Command-Line Arguments (sys.argv): Allows you to access arguments passed to the Python script when it's executed from the command line. Useful for providing flexibility in how your script interacts with input data.
