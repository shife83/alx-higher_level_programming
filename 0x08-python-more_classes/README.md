0x08. Python - More Classes and Objects
This project focuses on practicing your skills with classes and objects in Python.  Here's an overview:

Learning Objectives:

Enhance your understanding of classes and objects in Python
Practice writing clean and well-documented code
Implement Test-Driven Development (TDD) by writing tests before code
Explore special methods like __str__, __doc__, __init__, and __del__
Key Concepts:

Classes and Objects: Review the fundamentals of classes as blueprints for creating objects, and how objects are instances of classes with their own attributes and methods.
Test-Driven Development (TDD): Learn the TDD approach where you write tests (describing expected behavior) before writing the actual code. This helps ensure your code meets the requirements from the beginning.
Docstrings: Explore writing docstrings within your code to provide clear documentation for modules, functions, and classes. This enhances readability and maintainability.
Special Methods: Learn about special methods like __str__, __doc__, __init__, and __del__ that provide specific functionalities within classes. These methods handle tasks like string representation, attribute initialization, and object deletion.
