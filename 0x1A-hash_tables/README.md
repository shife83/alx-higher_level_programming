0x1A. C - Hash tables
This directory contains the C source code for a hash table implementation.

What is a hash table?

A hash table is a data structure that implements an associative array. It stores key-value pairs, where each key is mapped to a value. Hash tables use a hash function to convert a key into an index within a fixed-size array. This allows for efficient retrieval, insertion, and deletion of key-value pairs.

Project Structure

This project may contain several files, but typically includes:

hash_tables.h: Header file containing declarations for the hash table data structures and functions.
hash_tables.c: Implementation file containing the source code for the hash table functions.
main.c: Optional file containing a sample program that demonstrates how to use the hash table.
Building the Project

The specific build instructions will depend on your development environment. However, the general steps typically involve:

Compiling the source files (e.g., gcc hash_tables.c -o hash_tables).
Linking the compiled object files (if necessary).
Using the Hash Table

Refer to the hash_tables.h file for the available functions to interact with the hash table. These functions might include:

hash_table_create: Creates a new hash table.
hash_table_set: Inserts a key-value pair into the hash table.
hash_table_get: Retrieves the value associated with a key.
hash_table_delete: Deletes a key-value pair from the hash table.
hash_table_destroy: Frees the memory allocated for the hash table.
