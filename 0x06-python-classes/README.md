0x06. Python - Classes and Objects
This project delves into the fundamental concept of classes and objects in Python programming. Classes act as blueprints for creating objects, which are instances of those classes. They encapsulate data (attributes) and behavior (methods) associated with a particular entity.

Key Concepts:

Class: A blueprint defining the properties and functionalities of objects.
Object: An instance of a class, representing a specific entity with its own set of attributes and methods.
Attributes: Variables associated with an object that hold its data.
Methods: Functions defined within a class that define the object's behavior.
self parameter: The first argument implicitly passed to an object's methods, representing the object itself.
Constructor (__init__ method): A special method called upon object creation to initialize its attributes.
Encapsulation: The concept of bundling data and methods together within a class, promoting data protection and controlled access.
