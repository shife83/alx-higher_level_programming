0x05. Python - Exceptions
Introduction

This project delves into the essential concept of exceptions in Python programming. Exceptions are a powerful mechanism for handling unexpected errors or conditions that arise during program execution. They provide a way to gracefully manage these situations and prevent crashes, ensuring program robustness.

Key Concepts

try...except block: The fundamental structure for handling exceptions.
try block: Encloses code that might potentially raise an exception.
except block: Captures the exception and allows you to define custom behavior.
Exception types: Python has built-in exception types like ValueError, TypeError, IndexError, and FileNotFoundError. These represent specific kinds of errors.
Raising exceptions: Use the raise keyword to intentionally raise an exception to signal an error condition.
Project Structure (Example)

Python
def divide(x, y):
    """Divides two numbers, handling potential ZeroDivisionError."""
    try:
        result = x / y
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        print("Error: Cannot divide by zero.")
        return None  # Or handle the error differently (e.g., raise a custom exception)
    else:
        return result

# Example usage
try:
    num = divide(10, 2)
    print(num)  # Output: 5
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Unexpected error occurred.")  # Handle generic errors here

num = divide(10, 0)  # Output: Error: Cannot divide by zero.
                       # No further output
Use code with caution.
Learning Objectives

Understand the role of exceptions in error handling.
Employ try...except blocks effectively.
Leverage built-in exception types for common errors.
Practice raising custom exceptions when appropriate.
Write more robust and resilient Python code.
Additional Considerations

finally block: Optionally used to execute code regardless of whether an exception is raised or not (for cleanup tasks like closing files).
Custom exception classes: Create your own exception classes to encapsulate specific error conditions within your application.
Error handling strategies: Consider different approaches for handling errors, such as retrying operations, logging errors, or providing user-friendly error messages.
Further Exploration

Explore specific built-in exception types and their meanings.
Experiment with raising custom exceptions and handling them appropriately.
Apply exception handling techniques in real-world Python projects.
