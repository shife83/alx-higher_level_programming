Introduction

Inheritance is a fundamental object-oriented programming (OOP) concept that allows you to create new classes (subclasses or derived classes) that inherit properties and behaviors from existing classes (base classes or parent classes). This promotes code reusability, maintainability, and the creation of hierarchical class structures that model real-world relationships effectively.

Key Concepts

Base Class: The foundation class that defines attributes and methods that can be inherited by subclasses.
Sublass (Derived Class): A class that inherits from a base class, gaining access to its attributes and methods while potentially extending or specializing them.
Inheritance Relationship: The connection between a subclass and its base class. A subclass is "a kind of" its base class.
super() Function: A built-in function used in subclasses to access and potentially override inherited methods from the base class.
Method Overriding: The process of defining a method in a subclass that has the same name as a method in the base class, providing a specialized implementation for the subclass.
MRO (Method Resolution Order): The order in which Python searches for methods during method calls. It's determined by the inheritance hierarchy.
Benefits of Inheritance

Code Reusability: By inheriting common attributes and methods, you avoid code duplication and promote efficiency.
Maintainability: Changes made to the base class propagate to subclasses, reducing the need to modify code in multiple places.
Hierarchical Relationships: Inheritance enables you to model real-world entities and their relationships effectively. For example, Animal could be a base class with subclasses like Dog, Cat, and Bird, each inheriting general animal attributes and overriding methods for specific behaviors.
