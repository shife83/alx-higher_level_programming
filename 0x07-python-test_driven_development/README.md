0x07. Python - Test-Driven Development (TDD)
This project introduces you to Test-Driven Development (TDD) in Python.  TDD is a software development approach where you write tests that define the expected behavior of your code before you write the actual code itself.

Learning Objectives:

Grasp Test-Driven Development (TDD): Understand the TDD concept and its benefits for writing robust and well-tested code.
Practice TDD Workflow: Gain experience in applying the TDD workflow: writing tests, implementing code, and refactoring.
Explore Testing Frameworks: Utilize a testing framework like unittest or doctest to write your tests.
Craft Clear and Concise Tests: Write well-structured tests that clearly define the expected behavior of your code.
Enhance Code Quality: Improve code quality by identifying and fixing issues early through testing.
Key Concepts:

Test-Driven Development (TDD): A development approach where tests are written first to define expected behavior, followed by writing code to fulfill those expectations. This helps ensure code works as intended from the beginning.
Testing Frameworks: Python provides frameworks like unittest and doctest to simplify writing and managing test cases.
Test Cases: Specific scenarios or conditions that verify the functionality of your code. Well-written test cases cover various edge cases and ensure your code is robust.
Red-Green-Refactor Cycle: A common way to describe the TDD workflow:
Red: Write a failing test case that defines the expected behavior but fails initially because the code is not yet written.
Green: Implement the code to make the test case pass.
Refactor: Refine and improve the code while maintaining passing tests.
